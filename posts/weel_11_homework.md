## What were we trying to make?
Originally, when we saw that the video had to be 6-24 minutes long, we, as people who have way too much to work on with too little time, decided to create what was essentially a hypnotism video, as those tend to just be the same thing looped over and over for extended periods of time. This went all according to plan during the implemntation of the visual element, it was only when I came in (being in charge of the 'Strudel' portion of this task) that the plan was derailed.

I can get motion sickness from watching the screen of a device. Sometimes it gets as bad as me having to lie down just from scrolling too fast. And so, while trying to make the audio match with the visuals as part of a hypnotism video, I've decided that since this is practically torture for me, it'll probably be the same for other people. And so we pivoted.

Instead  of a hypnotism piece, it became a form of torture that probably violates some convention or rule of war somewhere (Geneva maybe?). I made the audio both high and droning because those noises tend to inflict the most damage (psychological tests have shown that being exposed to high pitched noises can affect people negatively) as well as weirdly creepy because clearly at this point everything I mmake becomes a form of horror for some reason. I also added a echoing beep of sorts that occurs every once in a while because of classical conditioning :). All in all I feel that we made quite a successful method of torture. Just sit someone in front of this piece for a few hours (or days) and they'll definitely spill all their secrets no questions asked.

(Actually having watched our work again for 5 minutes (migraines and dizziness be damned) I have come to the conclusion that actually it's a pretty effective form of brainwashing too)

## What was Frustrating
What was frustrating was 2 things:
1. constant disconnections because of spooty wifi or some other reason I had not figured out.
2. As a person who can get motion sickness from movement on screen, trying to create an audio piece that fits with what Hanh had done for the visual part was equal parts frustrating and vomit inducing. 3 days later from making this and I still have a major migraine and my eyes hurt as well.

## What was Rewarding
I would say that we accomplished our goal and quite well too.

## What is the live-coding community trying to do, and why.
I would say that perhaps they are trying to encourage more collaborations between people. Having people work together and share ideas on projects they are working on can serve to create more potential outcomes as the collaborators are inflenced by and influencing each other as they work.
