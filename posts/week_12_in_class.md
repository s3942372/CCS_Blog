# In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure?

The practice of creative coding - if established at a level where everyone can learn, has learnt and will learn - can allow for more transparency within the digital infrastructure. Technological companies will not be able to gouge users if users are able to do the same things that these companies are paid to do (and at times even better), which we can already see happening with the modding community when it comes to gaming.

Furthermore, tech companies will no longer be able to confuse the common populace with jargon and fool them into signing away things that should not be given away (souls being the best case scenario, their legal rights and online persona being scalped for AI algorithms being the worst).

Having normal people familiar with coding also allows for them to even the playing field. There is no longer as much of a power balance as there is now, between two (or more) groups of people, which then means that the digital infrastructure cannot hold up as it does now, and must (and will most likely) change allongside the users into a much more 'friendly' and 'well-balanced' one.
