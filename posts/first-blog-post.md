Hello, world!

# Week 1 Homework

## Part 1
Started to try and make a grid - wasn't very sure if we're making a static grid or one that moves like the example sketch did.

First tried to just input multiple copies of the already existing line of squares - did not work, could only have 4 of them on screen in total, not to mention they start to fuse together as they grew in size, so I'll just try to make a static square instead. Pretty sure that's what we're supposed to do anyways.

![what is this mess of squares really](/week_1_homework/whatisthismess.png)

I then tried to create an x-axis (a row) and a y-axis (a column) thinking that if I'm able to get those I'll be able to fill out the rest of the grid. Not sure if I succeeded or not. Got both a row and column, but they are entire bars,rectangles, not individual squares making up a row and a column.

Honestly I think I'm just messing around until something works.
