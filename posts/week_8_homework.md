I'm fairly certain I answered all of these in my assignment blog post so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to answer them again here, but here's basically a very short recap:

# Creative Process
Basically I asked myself whether I could and then if I should, to which the answer was a resounding 'YES'. The more chaotic elements I could add the better.

# Submission Response
I responded to Yehwan Song and their work ["Sound Interactive Poster"](https://www.yhsong.com/detail.html#aAa_Sound_Interactive_Poster). Originally the work was just supposed to be an image shuffling into random grids by being triggered by sound, much like how their work has a giant uppercase letter 'A' pushing apart two smaller lowercase 'a's each time they clapped. 

Everything else added was a result of me getting carried away asking myself how I could make the project even more chaotic.

# Techniques
Glitch and post-digital practices (sound/microphone).
