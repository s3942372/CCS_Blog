# I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS
1. How is this project an example of mycelial creativity?
'Mycelium creativity' draws upon the image of a fungal mycelium; although something might have started at one point with a certain purpose, over time it branches out and interacts with others, becoming something new each time. Lauren Lee McCarthy's work 'I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS' is an example of mycelial creativity because of how it can be used; its potential for more. Although it started off as a tool and statement used to express how McCarthy felt during the COVID-19 pandemic and the constant lockdowns (aptly named 'I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS' as even talking to one another was found to put others at risk of infection, even if one wears a mask), as it gradually begins to be used by more and more people, it can and will be found to have more uses than what it was originally created for. One example would be that it can be used by those with hearing or speech impediments (even those who are losing/have completely lost their hearing/speech) as a tool for communication. If allowed to have changes made to the project, perhaps it could be even further branched out by giving it a camera function to read out words, instead of just words typed in. And so, as more and more people use the work 'I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS', more and more ways to use the project will be discovered, with the resulting paths taken by McCarthy's creation resumbling that of a fungal mycelium, hence 'mycelium creativity'.

2. How does this project belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?
'Interesting', is both an aesthetic and an opinion. It is something 'cool', something more, something that stands out from the tedious and mundane. It is about the information of things, after all, something is interesting because it is an anomaly of the norm, an extraneous variable. It can be something continuous, a constant blip in the radar, and it can grow to be annoying.

Lauren Lee McCarthy's work 'I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS' is something that is vaguely interesting (just the slightest bit). It is interesting in that the voice that reads out the inputted text is machine-like, and when paired with a person standing in front of you, it is somewhat unexpected. Even if you know that it would not be the person speaking but the phone in their hands instead, the toneless, detached, machine-like voice still surprises a little - it is not what's expected - and so the project is interesting in this way. You do however soon become used to this, and the work quickly loses this element of surprise, and can even become tedious as you wait for someone to type out a reply to you and wait even longer for the emotionless delivery from the phone.

# Brainstorm A3: Communities of Practices

1. Domain
2. Shared values
3. Existing repertoire
4. How you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context

Idea 1:
- Pair a friend??? Kinda like Omegle.
- Input in the topics you like/are interested in.
- Wassat? Like stuff already in the field? Omegle.
- ohhhhhhhhhhhhh. Not stuff already in the field. Ok, gotta find a way to randomly pair two different people/devices together and have either microphone and sound input and output or a way for texts to reach each other. Gonna be anonymous too, cause since online stalking/doxxing is such a big issue now. Uh, people are paired at random too, so you (almost) never get the same person twice, unless your luck is very, very good.

Idea 2:
- Virtual pet simulator
- Raise a virtual pet of some sort (aquarium, dog, cat, hamster, one of those things that mess around your screen)
- Tomadatchis (is there a computer version?)
- ANIMATION NOOOOOOOOOOO........ click and drag?????

Idea 2.1:
- Can be virtual buddy instead
- Used by people who struggle to take care of themselves??
- Buddy won't eat until you do/reminds you to eat.
